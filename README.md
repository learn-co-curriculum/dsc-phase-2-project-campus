# Phase 2 Final Project

## Introduction

In this lesson, we review the guidelines for the Phase 2 Final Project.

## Objectives

You will be able to:

* Start your Phase 2 Final Project
* Check that your project meets the requirements
* Submit your project materials in Canvas
* Prepare for your project review

## Project Overview

Another module down--you're almost half way there!

All that remains in Phase 2 is to put our newfound data science skills to use with a final project! You should expect this project to take between 20 and 25 hours of solid, focused effort. If you're done way quicker, go back and dig in deeper or try some of the optional "level up" suggestions. If you're worried that you're going to get to 30 hrs and still not even have the data imported, reach out to an instructor in Slack ASAP to get some help!

### The Data

For this project, you'll be working with the King County House Sales dataset. We've modified the dataset to make it a bit more fun and challenging.  The dataset can be found in the file `"kc_house_data.csv"`, in this repo. You'll clean, explore, and model this dataset with a multivariate linear regression to predict the sale price of houses as accurately as possible.

The description of the column names can be found in the column_names.md file in this repository. As with most real world data sets, the column names are not perfectly described, so you'll have to do some research or use your best judgment if you have questions relating to what the data means.

It is up to you to decide what data from this dataset to use and how to use it. If you are feeling overwhelmed or behind (e.g. struggled with the Phase 2 Code Challenge), we recommend you ignore the following features:

* date
* view
* sqft_above
* sqft_basement
* yr_renovated
* zipcode
* lat
* long
* sqft_living15
* sqft_lot15

### Business Problem

For this project, it will be up to you to define a stakeholder and business problem appropriate to this dataset. If you are feeling overwhelmed or behind (e.g. struggled with the Phase 2 Code Challenge), we recommend you complete a project for a real estate agency that helps homeowners buy and/or sell homes. A business problem you could focus on is the need to provide advice to homeowners about how home renovations might increase the estimated value of their homes, and by what amount.

## Deliverables

There are three deliverables for this project:

1. A **GitHub repository**
2. A **Jupyter Notebook**
3. A **non-technical presentation**

Keep in mind that the audience for these deliverables is not only your teacher, but also potential employers. Employers will look at your project deliverables to evaluate multiple skills, including coding, modeling, communication, and domain knowledge. You will want to polish these as much as you can, both during the course and afterwards.

Review the rubric associated with this assignment to learn what makes for good deliverables.

### GitHub Repository

Your GitHub repository is the public-facing version of your project that your instructors and potential employers will see - make it as accessible as you can. At a minimum, it should contain all your project files and a README.md file that summarizes your project and helps visitors navigate the repository.

### Jupyter Notebook

Your Jupyter Notebook is the primary source of information about your analysis. At a minimum, it should contain or import all of the code used in your project and walk the reader through your project from start to finish. You may choose to use multiple Jupyter Notebooks in your project, but you should have one that provides a full project overview as a point of entry for visitors.

#### Iterative Modeling

**Your Jupyter Notebook should demonstrate an iterative approach to modeling.** This means that you begin with a basic model, evaluate it, and then provide justification for and proceed to a new model. After you finish refining your models, you should provide 1-3 paragraphs discussing your final model - this should include interpreting at least 3 important parameter estimates or statistics.

### Non-Technical Presentation

Your non-technical presentation is your opportunity to communicate clearly and concisely about your project and it's real-world relevance. The target audience should be people with limited technical knowledge who may be interested in leveraging your project. For Phase 1, these would be Microsoft executives interested in making decisions about movie development. We recommend using Google Slides, PowerPoint or Keynote to create your presentation slides.

**Based on the results of your models, your presentation should discuss at least two features that highly influence housing prices.**

## Getting Started

Please start by reviewing this document. If you have any questions, please ask your instructor ASAP.

Start on this project by forking [the Phase 2 Project Repository][], cloning it locally, and working in the `student.ipynb` file. Make sure to also add and commit a PDF of your presentation to your repository with a file name of `presentation.pdf`.

## Project Submission and Review

Review [the Phase Project Submission and Review guidance][] to learn how to submit your project and how it will be reviewed. Your project must pass review for you to progress to the next Phase.

## Summary

This project will give you a valuable opportunity to develop your data science skills using real-world data. The end-of-phase projects are a critical part of the program because they give you a chance to bring together all the skills you've learned, apply them to realistic projects for a business stakeholder, practice communication skills, and get feedback to help you improve. You've got this!
